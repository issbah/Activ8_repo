	<h1>Remember!</h1>
	<p> Choose fresh over processed whenever possible. </p>
	<p> Limit sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars. </p>
	<p> Desserts are not typically nutritious, however, if your body craves a flavor/food that may be classified as dessert, keep moderation/portion sizes in mind. </p>
	<p> In general, try to drink between half an ounce and an ounce of water for every pound of your bodyweight each day. </p>
	<p> How many servings you require for each food/ nutrient group depends on your personal needs. (Refer to the link in the Resources section below to learn more.) </p>
