  <center><h1>The Keto Diet</h1></center>
   </div>
<div class="lol">


<p>Keto is a low-carb, high-carb diet. It involves drastically reducing carbohydrates and replacing them with fat which helps put your body into a metabolic state known as Ketosis. When this happens your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy and also turns fat into ketones in the liver. Foods to AVOID while doing the keto diet are …...Sugary Foods like smoothies and cake, Grains and Starches (wheat-based products), Fruit (all fruit except small portions of berries and strawberries), Beans and Legumes, Root Vegetables, Low-fat or diet foods (highly processed and high in carbs), Sugar-free diet foods, Sauces and Alcohol. The food that you CAN EAT during Keto are Meat (Red meat, Steak, Ham, Sausage, Chicken and Turkey), Fatty Fish like Salmon, Eggs (grass-fed), Butter and Cream, Nuts and Seeds, Healthy Oils, Avocados, Low-carb Veggies and Condiments.

<center><h1>The Plant-Based Diet</h1></center>
</div>
<div class="lol">

<p>One of the most powerful steps you can take to improve your health, boost energy levels, and prevent chronic diseases is to move to a plant-based diet. If you’ve seen Forks Over Knives, you know that science shows changing your nutrition is a powerful way to live longer, help the environment, and reduce your risk of getting sick. Here’s a quick overview of the major food categories you’ll enjoy on a plant-based diet, with examples:

Fruits: any type of fruit including apples, bananas, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits, etc.
Vegetables: plenty of veggies including peppers, corn, avocados, lettuce, spinach, kale, peas, collards, etc.
Tubers: root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes, beets, etc.
Whole grains: grains, cereals, and other starches in their whole form, such as quinoa, brown rice, millet, whole wheat, oats, barley, etc. Even popcorn is a whole grain.
Legumes: beans of any kind, plus lentils, pulses, and similar ingredients.
There are plenty of other foods you can also enjoy— including nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh, whole-grain flour and breads, and plant-based milks. However, we recommend eating these foods in moderation, because they are more calorie-dense and can contribute to weight gain.</p>

  <center><h1>The Carb-Based Diet</h1></center>
   </div>
<div class="lol">
  <p>A low-carb diet is a diet that restricts carbohydrates, such as those found in sugary foods, pasta and bread. It is high in protein, fat and healthy vegetables. Your food choices depend on a few things, including how healthy you are, how much you exercise and how much weight you have to lose.

Consider this meal plan as a general guideline, not something written in stone.

Eat: Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, high-fat dairy, fats, healthy oils and maybe even some tubers and non-gluten grains.

Don't eat: Sugar, HFCS, wheat, seed oils, trans fats, "diet" and low-fat products and highly processed foods.
You should avoid these six food groups and nutrients, in order of importance:

Sugar: Soft drinks, fruit juices, agave, candy, ice cream and many other products that contain added sugar.
Refined grains: Wheat, rice, barley and rye, as well as bread, cereal and pasta.
Trans fats: Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils.
Diet and low-fat products: Many dairy products, cereals or crackers are fat-reduced, but contain added sugar.
Highly processed foods: If it looks like it was made in a factory, don't eat it.
Starchy vegetables: It’s best to limit starchy vegetables in your diet if you’re following a very low-carb diet.
You must read ingredient lists even on foods labelled as health foods.</p>

<center><h1>The Vegan Life</h1></center>
</div>
<div class="lol">
   <p>A vegan (say "VEE-gun" or "VAY-gun") diet is a total vegetarian diet. Besides not eating meat, vegans don't eat food that comes from animals in any way. That includes milk products, eggs, honey, and gelatin (which comes from bones and other animal tissue).vegans also need to make sure they get the following nutrients:

Protein. When considering a vegan diet, many people worry that they will not get enough protein. But eating a wide variety of protein-rich foods such as soy products, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds will give you the protein you need.
Omega-3 fatty acids. Without fish and eggs in your diet, you need to find other good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, such as hemp seeds, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, certain leafy green vegetables, soybean oil, canola oil, and sea vegetables (such as arame, dulse, nori, kelp, kombu or wakame).
Zinc. Your body absorbs zinc better when it comes from meat than when it comes from plants. But vegans don't usually have a problem getting enough zinc if they eat lots of other foods that are good sources of zinc, including whole-grain breads, cooked dried beans and lentils, soy foods, and vegetables.</p>

Fruits and vegetables
Beans, seeds and nuts in their natural, unprocessed forms
Eggs
Lean, nonprocessed meats, fish and poultry
Most low-fat dairy products
Grains, starches or flours that you can include in a gluten-free diet include:

Amaranth
Arrowroot
Buckwheat
Corn and cornmeal
Flax
Gluten-free flours (rice, soy, corn, potato, bean)
Hominy (corn)
Millet
Quinoa
Rice
Sorghum
Soy
Tapioca (cassava root)
Teff
Grains not allowed

Avoid all foods and drinks containing the following:

Barley
Rye
Triticale (a cross between wheat and rye)
